		While it is often useful to know when a cell gains focus (`kt-event key-focus`) it is equally useful to know when that cell loses focus. This event provides that ability and is triggered whenever a cell's focus is blurred. This can be the result of:

		* Focus moving to a different cell
		* Focus leaving the table (`kt-init keys.blurable`).

		This event will occur prior to the `kt-event key-focus` event (if there is a cell to be blurred - i.e. two cells can never have focus at the same time). Additionally, if a DataTables page change is required to display a newly focused cell, this event will occur before the page change is triggered.

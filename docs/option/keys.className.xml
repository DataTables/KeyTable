		Allowing the end user to visually identify which cell has focus is obviously fundamentally important to KeyTable's abilities, and this is done by adding a class to the focused cell. This class can then be styled using CSS to visually highlight the cell. The [CSS `outline` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline) is useful for this, and is the styling option used by the KeyTable default stylesheet.

		This property can be used to alter the class name used to show cell focus.

			As a boolean value this property will enable KeyTable on the DataTable that is being created. `true` will enable KeyTable, while `false` will not.

			This is a short-cut option to enable KeyTable with the default configuration options. Customisations can be made by giving this parameter as an object, see below.

	<type type="object">
		<description>
			If given as an object, KeyTable will be enabled on the target DataTable, with the KeyTable defaults (`$.fn.dataTable.KeyTable.defaults`) extended, and potentially overwritten, by the options provided in this object. This is how KeyTable can be configured on an individual table basis, or through the defaults.

		KeyTable will not be initialised by default

	<description>
		KeyTable is an extension for DataTables that provides spreadsheet like keyboard navigation in a table, with the focused cell being movable with arrow keys, tab, home, end and page up / down. KeyTable will automatically adjust the table's paging and other parameters to show the focused cell as the user navigates around the table. Combined with [Editor](//editor.datatables.net) it makes it super easy to create an Excel like user interface in the browser.

		This option provides the ability to enable and configure KeyTable for DataTables. In its simplest form as the boolean `true` it will enable KeyTable with the default configuration options (as defined by `$.fn.dataTable.KeyTable.defaults`). It can also be used as an object to provide custom configuration options as described below.

		Please note that as with all other configuration options for KeyTable, this option is an extension to the [default set of DataTables options](/reference/option). This property should be set in the DataTables initialisation object.

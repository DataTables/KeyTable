		The table will not automatically receive focus when initialised
	</default>

	<description>
		This option can be used to define what cell in the table (if any) will automatically receive focus when the table is initialised with KeyTable enabled.

		The value of this option will be over-ridden if state saving is enabled in DataTables (`dt-init stateSave`) and there is a saved focused cell - i.e. the state saved focused cell will instead receive the focus.

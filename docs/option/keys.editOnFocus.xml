	<default value="false">
		The cell is not automatically put into inline editing mode when the cell is focused.

	<description>
		When used with Editor (`-init keys.editor`), inline editing will not be triggered by KeyTable until a key value is pressed when a cell is focused (similar to Excel). However, you may wish to immediately place the cell into edit mode when the focus happens. This option provides that ability.

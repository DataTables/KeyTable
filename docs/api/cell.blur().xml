	<description>
		This method provides the ability to programmatically blur focus from a table (i.e. remove focus). Please note that it is not cell specific - i.e. you do not use `dt-api cell()`, but rather simply the `cell` property of the API.

		Tables which are disabled (`kt-api keys.disable()`) cannot be blurred. You must either blur the table before disabling, or re-enable the table (`kt-api keys.enable()`) to allow blurring, even via the API.

		This method will not throw any errors if executed on a table that already does not have focus. The `kt-event key-blur` event will not be triggered, but otherwise there will be no notification that a blur did not occur.

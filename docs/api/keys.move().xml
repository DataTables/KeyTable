	<description>
		This method can be used to access KeyTable's internal logic to move the focus of a cell to an adjacent cell, taking into account paging, filtering, ordering, server-side processing, etc.

		Note that if you know the cell (by node or index) you want to move the focus to use `-api cell().focus()`.
